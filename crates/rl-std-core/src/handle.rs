//! The native-function descriptor embedded in each runtime and the arity
//! metadata it carries.
//!
//! The load-bearing design point: [`NativeHandle::thunk`] is a **thin `fn`
//! pointer**, not a boxed `Rc<dyn Fn>`/`Arc<dyn Fn>`. It is generic over the
//! [`Runtime`] so each runtime monomorphizes the same stdlib body into one
//! concrete function pointer - no per-function heap allocation, no vtable
//! dispatch, and the whole descriptor stays `Copy` so the VM can embed it as a
//! bytecode constant.
